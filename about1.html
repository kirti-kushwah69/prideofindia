				<h4>histroy of gwalior fort <i class="fa-brands fa-fort-awesome"></i></h4>
				<p class="p">One of the oldest forts in Madhya Pradesh as well as in India, Gwalior Fort is known for its stunning architecture and unique history. Sprawling and offering unforgettable city views, this hill fort has been ruled by dynasties of different kingdoms over the years. It is also considered as one of the most impenetrable forts in the country. Hence, if you are passionate about different cultures and their past glories, a visit to Gwalior Fort is a must.<br>
				The exact period during which the Gwalior Fort was constructed is not yet known. According to legends, this imposing fort was built in the 3rd century by a local king Suraj Sen. The king had recently been cured of leprosy with the help and blessings of a sage named Gwalipa, who had offered him water from a sacred pond. The grateful king then built this fort and named it after the sage. The word Gwalior is derived from the saint's name- Gwalipa. The sage bestowed the title Pal, which means protector, upon the king; and declared that the fort would remain in his family's possession as long as they bore this title. Interestingly enough, the fort remained with the 83 descendants of Suraj Sen Pal, but the 84th descendant named Tej Karan lost the fort.<br>
				In the years that followed, the Gwalior Fort has witnessed many ups and downs. It also changed hands many times and has been held by the Tomars, Mughals, Marathas, and the British, before finally being handed over to the Scindias.
