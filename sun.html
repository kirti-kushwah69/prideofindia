		<p class="gwal">At a distance of 5 km from Gwalior Fort and 5 km from the Gwalior Junction, Surya Mandir or Sun Temple is a Hindu temple in the historic city of Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. Situated near the Residency at Morar, Sun Temple is one of the most famous heritage monuments in Gwalior and also one of the top places to visit in Gwalior.Dedicated to Sun God, Surya Mandir is one of the popular pilgrimage places in Gwalior. Also known as Vivaswan Temple, Surya Mandir was constructed in 1988 by G.D Birla, the famous industrialist of India. The Surya Mandir is a new one in the list of the grand historical monuments of Gwalior and it does not even have any historical significance.The temple is the replica of the famous Sun Temple of Konark in Orissa. The temple is one of the architectural wonders and has a beautiful sculpture of Lord Surya in the temple premises. The temple building is created in the shape of chariot pulled by seven horses each one depicting seven days of the week. One can also see total 24 wheels representing the 24 hours of a day. There are total 365 idols of Gods around the temple for 365 days in a year.The contrasting color combination of the exteriors with the interiors of the temple is another fantastic feature. The exterior is built of red sandstone whereas the interiors are made of marble. This gives a more exotic look to the temple. The exteriors of the temple are also decorated with numerous stone carved images depicting various Hindu gods. The temple is located in a serene ambience and a well-maintained garden within the temple premises is very attractive. This holy temple draws the locals and tourists alike who gather here to render their prayers.</p>
