		<p class="gwal">Tighra Dam was constructed in 1916 on the Sank River and is a major source of water for the city of Gwalior. This dam has been constructed in the vicinity of eleven villages. The villagers depend on this dam for their irrigation, drinking and domestic purpose. The dam is an engineering marvel and is 24 meters high at its crest, and 1341 m long. The reservoir has a capacity of 4.8 million cubic meters. The dam was failed twice due to infiltration in 1917 & in 1970 respectively. However, today it has emerged as a favourite destination for families to spend some good time together.As tourism gained popularity, the tourist department started a boating club here. One can enjoy speed boating, jalpari boat, paddle boating and water scooty rides at Tighra Dam. Apart from adventure, it also offers serenity with the picturesque view that surrounds the dam. After the construction of the dam, the area became a suitable habitat for several birds and this area was later declared as a Bird Sanctuary. The reservoir is home to many crocodiles and many different fishes can be seen during boating.</p>
