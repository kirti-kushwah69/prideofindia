		<p class="gwal">The impressive Teli ka Mandir inside the Gwalior Fort, one of the tallest structures in the complex, is an example of the Dravidian style architecture and can be counted as one of the most beautiful shrines dedicated to Lord Vishnu. It was built in 9th century AD during the reign of Pratihara king Mihir Bhoja. As per a legend, it was built with the money donated by oil merchants. Hence, the name Teli Ka Mandir! Tourists can also find this information in the inscription written on the main gate of the temple.Around 30-meter in height, the temple comprises a sanctum accompanied by a porch and a doorway. There are stairs in the east to enter this marvelous architecture. The special feature of the temple is its arched roof, built in the Dravidian style. It is a perfect example of amalgamation of North Indian and South Indian temple architecture. The shape of the roof can be easily identified as an example of Dravidian style of architecture, while the embellishments are Indo-Aryan. The decorations resemble those found in northern India and figures of river goddesses, coiled serpents, amorous couples, and flying Garuda can be seen here.The two pavilions and the entrance to the eastern side of the temple were built later by an English architect. The British used the temple courtyard as a coffee shop that is mentioned in the inscription on the main entrance.</p>
